# TFAR_teamspeakRequirement
Just a simple script that forces players in Arma 3 to have their Teamspeak 3 Task-Force-Radio plugin enabled.

## How to install
Move the files `initPlayerLocal.sqf` and `tfar_teamspeakRequirement.fsm` into your arma 3 mission folder's root.
After you have done that you have to change the `<serverName>` in your recently moved `initPlayerLocal.sqf` to your Teamspeak 3's server name.

You are done!
